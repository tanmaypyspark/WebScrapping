If  that  happens,  Tata  Chemicals  holds  roughly  3  percent  in  Tata  Sons,  which  at  current  price  is  roughly  equal  to  the  market  cap  of  Tata  Chemicals.  Bull  argument:  The  Tata  Sons  IPO  will  most  likely  happen  in  September  2025.  Also,  Tata  Chemicals  is  set  to  commission  a  new  soda  ash  plant.  Bear  argument:  The  Tata  group  may  find  another  way  to  comply  with  the  RBI  requirement  without  necessarily  listing  Tata  Sons.  There  are  certain  short-term  challenges  in  the  soda  ash  demand-supply  dynamics  due  to  weak  demand  in  Western  Europe.
