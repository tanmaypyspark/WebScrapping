Bull  argument:  The  Tata  Sons  IPO  will  most  likely  happen  in  September  2025.  Also,  Tata  Chemicals  is  set  to  commission  a  new  soda  ash  plant.  Bear  argument:  The  Tata  group  may  find  another  way  to  comply  with  the  RBI  requirement  without  necessarily  listing  Tata  Sons.  There  are  certain  short-term  challenges  in  the  soda  ash  demand-supply  dynamics  due  to  weak  demand  in  Western  Europe.

IPO  will  definitely  be  there.  ET  wants  to  damage  any  rising  business  conglomerate.  Earlier  they  damaged  Adani  and  they  want  to  damage  Tatas,  next  may  be  Ambani.

Tata  Trusts  continued  opposition  to  the  transfer  of  Tata  Sons  pledged  shares  may  pose  a  significant  challenge  to  the  Shapoorji  Pallonji  Groups  efforts  to  refinance  its  loans.

Tata  Sons  shares  cannot  be  used  as  collateral  for  fresh  loans  by  the  Shapoorji  Pallonji  Group,  Siddharth  Sharma,  chief  executive  of  Tata  Trusts,  told  Mint.  The  group  plans  to  use  the  18.4  percent  shares  it  owns  in  Tata  Sons  as  collateral  to  replace  its  loans  totalling  Rs  22,000  crore  dolr2.6  billion  payable  by  March.  The  shares  are  already  pledged  against  these  loans,  and  the  aim  is  to  transfer  the  shares  to  a  new  set  of  investors  to  raise  money  to  repay  the  earlier  loan.

Why  its  important-  The  friction  between  the  Shapoorji  Pallonji  Group,  the  largest  public  shareholder  of  Tata  Sons,  and  the  philanthropic  entities  that  control  the  Tata  empire  remains  despite  a  change  of  guard  at  the  Tata  Trusts,  with  Noel  Tata  taking  over  as  chairman.

Tata Chemicals,"Tata  Chemicals  is  ready  for  a  breakout  on  the  daily  chart  with  a  significant  increase  in  trading  volume,  indicating  a  potential  breakout.  If  the  price  manages  to  close  above  Rs  1,160  levels,  it  may  have  the  potential  to  reach  a  short-term  target  of  Rs  1,320.  On  the  other  hand,  the  immediate  support  level  is  located  at  Rs  1,100.  These  levels  can  be  considered  as  opportunities  to  buy  on  dips.  The  Relative  Strength  Index  (RSI)  currently  stands  at  62.3  and  is  trending  upward,  indicating  increasing  buying  momentum.  To  prudently  manage  risk,  it  is  advisable  to  set  a  stop-loss  at  Rs  1,080.  This  precaution  will  help  protect  your  investment  in  case  of  an  unexpected  market  reversal.  In  summary,  considering  the  technical  analysis  and  the  current  market  conditions,  Tata  Chemicals  appears  to  present  an  appealing  buying  opportunity  for  those  aiming  for  a  Rs  1,320  price  target,  provided  that  appropriate  risk  management  measures  are  in  place.",kamal20,2024-06-21 08:45:00
