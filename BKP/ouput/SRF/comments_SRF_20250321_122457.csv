SRF,"SRF  has  been  trending  higher  within  an  upward-sloping  parallel  channel.  It  recently  broke  out  from  a  symmetrical  triangular  pattern,  indicating  continued  upward  movement.  The  MACD  has  provided  a  bullish  crossover  on  the  daily  charts,  and  the  weekly  momentum  is  already  bullish.  From  a  derivatives  perspective,  the  stock  has  seen  significant  short-covering,  initially  in  August,  there  were  heavy  short  positions,  which  have  now  been  covered,  and  some  long  buildup  is  evident.  A  range  breakout  is  anticipated,  potentially  leading  to  a  sharp  short-term  upmove.  Options  data  suggests  that  once  the  Rs  2,600  strike  level  is  surpassed,  there  is  no  major  hurdle  from  Call  writers.",kamal20,2024-09-02 22:53:00

SRF,"Dear  longinnings,        Pl  see  the  news  section  of  moneycontrol  on  SRF  and  also  see  the  monthly  chart  of  SRF.    As  per  them,  the    Entire  Ageochemical  sector  is  in  revival  after  Q1  results.      Tgt  given  for  SRF  for  next  week  is  2710.  if  it    sustains  there,  it  will  be  coming  out  of  almost  36  months  consolidation  zone.  It  means  no  stopping  after  that  because  it  will  be  a  BO  on  monthly  charts  after      36  months  consolidation.  Big  players    and  world  will  run  behind  this    stock  .  This  time  there  are  very  high  chances  of  sustaining  above  2700  levels  because  ,  it  is  approaching  this  level  in  Higher  High  pattern  with  good  volunes.

SRF,Further  to  my  earlier  message..  The  price  may  not  crash  immediately  as  several  strong  investors  are  in  Chemical  space.  But  exit  of  large  investors  is  happening  gradually.  To  faciliatte  their  exit  price  will  be  managed  at  higher  level  till  quarterly  results.,Cool Bull,2024-06-26 10:17:00
SRF,Yes.  Time  to  exit  SRF  and  it  appears  Navn  Flourine.  It  seems  China  has  come  back  strongly  in  Chemical  space  and  hence  the  extra  ordinary  margins  of  the  recent  past  may  not  be  repeated.  Hence  it  is  prudent  to  exit  now  when  price  is  good  and  reenter  hen  picture  becomes  clearer  post  quarterly  numbers.    Long  term  story  is  strong  no  doubt  but  the  valuations  are  too  rich.  That  is  why  during  past  several  days  in  derivatives  we  are  seeing  long  unwinding.  This  started  after  the  recent  run  up.  May  be  pump  and  dump  strategy  by  the  FIIs  and  informed  investors.  Better  to  be  cautious.,Cool Bull,2024-06-26 10:06:00

SRF,"Their  capex  pattern  is  bit  confusing.  Chemicals  is  a  high  margin  business.  So  investing  in  Chemicals  for  new  molecules  would  have  been  better  compared  to  capex  for  packaging,  unless  there  is  very  strong  immediate  tailwind.  I  feel  there  is  an  error  of  judgement  because  of  over  conservative  mindset  of  SRF  management  this  time.

SRF,If  we  see  price  action  of  both  SRF  and  Navin  fluorine  today  it  appears  investors  are  selling  SRF  and  loading  on  Navin  Fluorine  as  latter  has  corrected  and  at  the  same  time  invested  in  right  areas.  There  is  no  baggage  of  packaging  there.  It  makes  sense  to  invest  in  Navin  Fluorine  to  play  Chemicals  recovery  than  SRF.,Cool Bull,2024-05-16 11:21:00
SRF,"Another  factor  which  may  affect  valuations  of  SRF  is  their  investment  in  packaging.  I  think  management  strategy  went  wrong  here  as  entire  capex  incurred  in  packaging  may  yield  negative  returns  as  there  is  excess  capacity.  This  does  not  recover  quickly.    So,  the    company  has  to  come  out  with  some  winner  in  Chemicals  space  to  maintain  growth.",Cool Bull,2024-05-16 10:33:00
SRF,"In  the  concall  the  mngt  clearly  said  that  the  recovery  has  started.  Yes  there  is  margin  pressure,  but  that  doesnt  mean  recovery  is  not  there.  H1  FY2025  will  appear  a  steady  growth.  From  H2  FY2025,  the  volume  led  recovery  will  be  high.  Hence  the  U  curve  recovery  has  started.  It  is  the  best  time  to  invest  in  chemical  stocks.",CFO_AM,2024-05-15 23:25:00
SRF,"Debt  trap  may  not  be  there.  The  company  has  enough  cashflow  to  take  care  of  debt.  However  the  company  has  incurred  heavy  capex  both  in  Chemicals  and  Packaging  segments  and  profit  margins  have  suffered  in  both  the  verticals.  In  fact  during  Concall  discomfort  of  promoter  about  the  recovery  time  line  was  clearly  evident.    When  asked  repeatedly  he  mentioned  recovery  may  be  possible  in  second  half  of  FY  25.  But  I  felt  conviction  about  recovery  was  absent.  Hence  if  lower  margin  scenario  continues  in  Chemicals  for  some  more  time  all  ratios  will  get  affected  .  As  of  now  the  company  is  enjoying  dream  valuation.  That  is  why  promoter  must  be  off  loading  in  small  quantity.    While  debt  servicing  may  not  be  a  problem  equity  returns  are  going  to  be  subdued.  Any  way  picture  will  be  clearer  in  next  quarter  results.  The  company  did  not  declare  any  Dividend  now.  If  it  does  not  declare  any  dividend  next  quarter  also,  then  there  can  be  trouble.",Cool Bull,2024-05-15 19:01:00
