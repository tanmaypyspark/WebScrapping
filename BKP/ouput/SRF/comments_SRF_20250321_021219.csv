Now  with  China  coming  back  aggressively  margins  are  likely  to  take  hit  like  what  is  happening  in  API.  If  that  happens  PE  multiples  also  would  go  down  to  realistic  25  levels.  So,  scope  for  correction  is  large.",Cool Bull,2025-03-05 11:01:00

Jefferes  target  appears  reasonable.  Otherwise  all  these  brokerages  gave  higher  targets  and  made  retailers  buy    and  enabled  FII  dumping.

SRF,In  Chemical  Industry  as  I  understand  recovery  has  to  accompany  improvements  in  margin.  Otherwise  it  is  only  volume  growth.  That  means  the  respective  chemical  molecule  is  getting  commoditised.  Hence  it  is  essential  to  come  out  with  newer  and  newer  molecules  which  is  being  done  by  PI  industries  on  regular  basis.

H1  FY2025  will  appear  a  steady  growth.  From  H2  FY2025,  the  volume  led  recovery  will  be  high.  Hence  the  U  curve  recovery  has  started.

SRF,"Debt  trap  may  not  be  there.  The  company  has  enough  cashflow  to  take  care  of  debt.  However  the  company  has  incurred  heavy  capex  both  in  Chemicals  and  Packaging  segments  and  profit  margins  have  suffered  in  both  the  verticals.  In  fact  during  Concall  discomfort  of  promoter  about  the  recovery  time  line  was  clearly  evident.    When  asked  repeatedly  he  mentioned  recovery  may  be  possible  in  second  half  of  FY  25.  But  I  felt  conviction  about  recovery  was  absent.  Hence  if  lower  margin  scenario  continues  in  Chemicals  for  some  more  time  all  ratios  will  get  affected  .  As  of  now  the  company  is  enjoying  dream  valuation.  That  is  why  promoter  must  be  off  loading  in  small  quantity.    While  debt  servicing  may  not  be  a  problem  equity  returns  are  going  to  be  subdued.  Any  way  picture  will  be  clearer  in  next  quarter  results.  The  company  did  not  declare  any  Dividend  now.

While  they  would  be  operationally  sound  and  profitable,  their  fat  profit  margins  will  come  down  because  of  lifting  of  anti  dumping  duty.
