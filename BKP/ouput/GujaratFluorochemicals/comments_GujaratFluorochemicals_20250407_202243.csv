therefore  traders  who  strictly  know  volatility  in  the  market  and  know  how  to  enter  stoploss  can  think  of  conditional  buy  say  couple  rupees  above  days  high.

if  and  once  triggered  within  minutes  share  price  can  rise  very  sharp  initially  due  to  fresh  buying  interest  and  subsequently  due  to  short  covering

A.  First  and  foremost,  10  percent  additional  duty  by  US  on  Chinese  imports  ,  means  immediate  rush  of  orders  as  India  suddenly  is  very  competitive  in  Chemicals  and  speciality  chemicals.
B.  Second  biggest  positive  news  is  net  profits  of  Dec  24  rises  by  ,57.5  percent  compared  to  80  Crore  net  profits  for  Dec  23  of  800  Cr.
C.  Share  is  at  22  percent  heavy  discount  from  the  52week  high
