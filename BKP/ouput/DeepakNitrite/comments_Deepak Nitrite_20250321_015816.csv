Deepak Nitrite,Tomorrow  the  concall  is  there  at  3  pm  will  be  interesting  to  hear  what  commentary  the  mgt  gives.  Dont  forget  chemical  stocks  are  rebounding  and  next  quarter  should  be  even  stronger  so  declines  can  be  used  to  add.  Even  the  promoter  has  bought  in  June  end  above  2500  so  that  gives  a  good  amount  of  confidence.  Lot  of  shorts  were  built  up  today  as  futures  have  gone  into  a  discount  for  sept  and  Oct.  Any  short  squeeze  and  we  could  see  a  upward  rally.,ahuja.12,2024-08-05 21:45:00
